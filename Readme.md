About the Project
The LeetCode Full Stack Project is a collection of assignments designed to teach web development skills and encourage open-source contributions. Each assignment is similar in structure and difficulty to problems found on LeetCode, but with a focus on web development topics such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, and more.

The assignments are divided into different categories, each of which corresponds to a different web development topic. As you progress through the assignments, you will build a portfolio of projects that demonstrate your skills in these areas.
